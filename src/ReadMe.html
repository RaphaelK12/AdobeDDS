<h1>Adobe DDS plug-in</h1>

<p>This is a plug-in for reading and writing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface">DirectDraw Surface (DDS)</a> format in Adobe After Effects and Photoshop. DDS uses compression formats that can be decompressed in a GPU, so the format is commonly used to store textures. It also supports other relevant features such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">mipmaps</a>.</p>

<p>Written by Brendan Bolles of <a href="http://www.fnordware.com/">fnord software</a>. Made possible by the sponsorship of Walter Soyka of <a href="http://www.keenlive.com/">Keen Live</a>.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

Photoshop CS6 or later, After Effects CS6 or later.  Mac OS X 10.6 or later, Windows 7 or later.  May work in older configurations as well, give it a try.

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Manually copy the plug-in to your host application's plug-in folder. Double-clicking the plug-in file will not install it.</p>

<h2>Compression Formats</h2>

Most DDS files use one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression">S3 Texture Compression</a> formats, commonly known as DXTn. Support for ATI's 3Dc/DXN format is also provided, as well as the option to store images uncompressed.</p>

<p><table border=1>
<tr> <td> <b>Format</b> </td> <td> <b>Channels</b> </td> <td> <b>Alpha Type</b> </td> <td> <b>Premultiplied</b> </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT1 </td> <td> RGB </td> <td> None </td> <td> N/A </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT1A </td> <td> RGBA </td> <td> 1-bit </td> <td> N/A </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT2 </td> <td> RGBA </td> <td> Explicit </td> <td> Yes </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT3 </td> <td> RGBA </td> <td> Explicit </td> <td> No </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT4 </td> <td> RGBA </td> <td> Interpolated </td> <td> Yes </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT5 </td> <td> RGBA </td> <td> Interpolated </td> <td> No </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXT5A </td> <td> A </td> <td> Alpha as Luma </td> <td> N/A </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 3Dc </td> <td> XY </td> <td> None </td> <td> N/A </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> DXN </td> <td> YX </td> <td> None </td> <td> N/A </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Uncompressed </td> <td> RGB(A) </td> <td> Uncompressed </td> <td> Undefined </td> </tr>
</table></p>

<p>The difference between the DXTn formats is how they handle alpha.  DXT2/3 are better suited for alpha channels with hard edges, while DXT4/5 are better suited for soft-edged alphas.  DXT 2 & 4 expect the RGB to be premultiplied, while DXT 3 & 5 do not.</p>

<p>Managing the premultiplied state of the alpha is left up to the user.  In After Effects, you should set the output module's premultiplied state to match the format you're going to be using. In Photoshop, the plug-in provides an option to preform a premultiplication, and it is left up to the user to do use this feature where appropriate.</b>

<p>DXT5A saves only the alpha channel, at high quality. 3Dc and DXN are intended for normal maps. Uncompressed storage is not supported by most applications that use DDS.</p>
